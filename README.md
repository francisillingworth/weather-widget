# Weather Widget

This is a simple web application that allows the user to find the weather forecast for any city in the world (with the exception of those with the same city name e.g Birmingham, UK and Birmingham, Alabama, USA).


## Demo

A live Demo of the app can be found [here](https://francisillingworth.github.io/weather-widget/)

## UX

This website has been designed to be as user friendly as possible. The colour scheme is neutral using a pastel palate and the instructions for use are made clear.

The results of any seaches are made as clear as possible by emphasizing the weather type logo right beneath the search bar to provide an intuative and easily understandble indicator of weather. More advanced results such as wind speed can then be found lower down with results decreasing in importance the futher you go down the list.

The appliction is responsive and will respond to changes in browser window size.
